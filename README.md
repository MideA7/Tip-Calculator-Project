# Tip-Calculator-Project

A simple Tip Calculator demo that demonstrates basic UI, calculation logic, and use of browser localStorage to persist user input.

## Overview

- Enter a bill amount and the app calculates a 15% tip and the total.
- The last entered bill amount is saved in localStorage so it persists between sessions.
- Minimal, focused project for learning DOM manipulation, events, and client-side storage.
